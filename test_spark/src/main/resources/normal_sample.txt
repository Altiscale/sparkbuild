Hi Andrew, I think people need to spend more time on the data science and not on the Hadoop infrastructure. 
Customers are finding Altiscaleâ€™s optimized solution faster, more reliable, easier to use, and more affordable than alternatives.
You can also try out Spark on YARN with Altiscale, and this provide some examples to run some pyspark MLLib APIs 
on Spark. Try it out and let me know how it goes.
