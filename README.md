sparkbuild
==========

Init sparkbuild wrapper repo for Spark incubation

Branch follows the following naming convention to align with each Spark version.

```
altiscale-branch-1.4
altiscale-branch-1.5
altiscale-branch-1.6
...
```

and so does the `spark` source code, we also use the same branch name to align with
the same `sparkbuild` branch as well.
